This directory contains javascript with ES6 features which is transpiled into js.generated folder with babel by gulp webpack task.

Currently this generated files are committed into git (also not minified). This allows to keep all build in dev and don't change anything
in production (i.e. don't have node and all this stuff).

.map files are not committed and kept locally (this can be changed if needed).
