Simple todo file to keep track of things to do one day:

- documents: update ? --- ask Denish for update contents??
- documents: upload large files.
- documents: strange - looks like there are no checks on where to upload a file
- folders: check, that lookup honors permissions and won't accept inaccessible folder

- accounts tests (+ security tests)
- ? rest token expiry (and multi-tokens per user?)
- ? plan endpoint
- customer_io.signals.event_document_created - check proper signals are fired in API
- ~~check if query_set=.. is exposed to API View and fix it in some way~~
- review API viewer for voting not to expose questions of others
